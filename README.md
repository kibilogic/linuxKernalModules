creating a proc entry

After searching online for some examples and finding that most were outdated.

I decided that I would create a template of sorts for creating a proc entry that would allow for reading and writing. 

Something fairly basic but insightful enough for understanding the kernel data structures applicable to the kernel version that I was using, 4.2.0.
